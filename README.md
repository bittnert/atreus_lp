# Atreus Low Profile Keyboard

This repository contains the files for a low profile variant of the atreus keyboard. THe original atreus keyboard can be found [[https://gitlab.com/technomancy/atreus][here]].

** The low profile atreus keyboard is still under development. The first PCB version has been ordered but not build or tested yet. **

The Keyboard uses Kailh Choc key switches which are soldered into a PCB. An addressable LED can be added to each key switch. Due to the size constraints, only 2020 LEDs (or smaller) can be used.
